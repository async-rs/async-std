# Introduction

![async-std logo](./images/horizontal_color.svg)

This book serves as high-level documentation for `async-std` and a way of learning async programming in Rust through it. As such, it focuses on the `async-std` API and the task model it gives you.

Please note that the Rust project provides its own book on asynchronous programming, called ["Asynchronous Programming in Rust"][async-book], which we highly recommend reading along with this book, as it provides a different, wider view on the topic.
