# Tutorial: Writing a chat

Nothing is simpler than creating a chat server, right?
Not quite, chat servers expose you to all the fun of asynchronous programming:

How will the server handle clients connecting concurrently?

How will it handle them disconnecting?

How will it distribute the messages?

This tutorial explains how to write a chat server in `async-std`.

You can also find the tutorial in [our repository](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/blob/master/examples/a-chat).
