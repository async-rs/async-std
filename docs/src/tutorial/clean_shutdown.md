## Clean Shutdown

One of the problems of the current implementation is that it doesn't handle graceful shutdown.
If we break from the accept loop for some reason, all in-flight tasks are just dropped on the floor.
A more correct shutdown sequence would be:

1. Stop accepting new clients
2. Deliver all pending messages
3. Exit the process

A clean shutdown in a channel based architecture is easy, although it can appear a magic trick at first.
In Rust, receiver side of a channel is closed as soon as all senders are dropped.
That is, as soon as producers exit and drop their senders, the rest of the system shuts down naturally.
In `async_std` this translates to two rules:

1. Make sure that channels form an acyclic graph.
2. Take care to wait, in the correct order, until intermediate layers of the system process pending messages.

In `a-chat`, we already have an unidirectional flow of messages: `reader -> broker -> writer`.
However, we never wait for broker and writers, which might cause some messages to get dropped.
Let's add waiting to the server:

    }

    for writer in writers { // 4
        writer.await;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Notice what happens with all of the channels once we exit the accept loop:

1. First, we drop the main broker's sender.
   That way when the readers are done, there's no sender for the broker's channel, and the chanel closes.
2. Next, the broker exits `while let Some(event) = events.next().await` loop.
3. It's crucial that, at this stage, we drop the `peers` map.
   This drops writer's senders.
4. Now we can join all of the writers.
5. Finally, we join the broker, which also guarantees that all the writes have terminated.
