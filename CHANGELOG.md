# [0.99.11] - 2019-10-29

This patch introduces `async_std::sync::channel`, a novel asynchronous port of
the ultra-fast Crossbeam channels. This has been one of the most anticipated
features for async-std, and we're excited to be providing a first version of
this!

In addition to channels, this patch has the regular list of new methods, types,
and doc fixes.

## Examples

__Send and receive items from a channel__
```rust
// Create a bounded channel with a max-size of 1
let (s, r) = channel(1);

// This call returns immediately because there is enough space in the channel.
s.send(1).await;

task::spawn(async move {
    // This call blocks the current task because the channel is full.
    // It will be able to complete only after the first message is received.
    s.send(2).await;
});

// Receive items from the channel
task::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
assert_eq!(r.recv().await, Some(1));
assert_eq!(r.recv().await, Some(2));
```

- Added `Stream::sum` as "unstable"
- Added `Stream::min_by_key`
- Added `Stream::max_by`
- Added `Stream::timeout` as "unstable"
- Added `sync::channel` as "unstable".
- Added doc links from instantiated structs to the methods that create them.
- Implemented `Extend` + `FromStream` for `PathBuf`.

- Fixed issues with our Clippy check on CI.
- Replaced our uses of `cfg_if` with our own macros, simplifying the codebase.
- Updated the homepage link in `Cargo.toml` to point to [async.rs](https://async.rs).

- Various typos and grammar fixes.

# [0.99.10] - 2019-10-16

This patch stabilizes several core concurrency macros, introduces async versions
of `Path` and `PathBuf`, and adds almost 100 other commits.

## Examples

__Asynchronously read directories from the filesystem__
```rust
use async_std::fs;
use async_std::path::Path;
use async_std::prelude::*;

let path = Path::new("/laputa");
let mut dir = fs::read_dir(&path).await.unwrap();
while let Some(entry) = dir.next().await {
    if let Ok(entry) = entry {
        println!("{:?}", entry.path());
    }
}
```

__Cooperatively reschedule the current task on the executor__
```rust
use async_std::prelude::*;
use async_std::task;

task::spawn(async {
    let x = fibonnacci(1000); // Do expensive work
    task::yield_now().await;  // Allow other tasks to run
    x + fibonnacci(100)       // Do more work
})
```

__Create an interval stream__
```rust
use async_std::prelude::*;
use async_std::stream;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut interval = stream::interval(Duration::from_secs(4));
while let Some(_) = interval.next().await {
    println!("prints every four seconds");
}
```

# [0.99.9] - 2019-10-08

This patch upgrades our `futures-rs` version, allowing us to build on the 1.39
beta. Additionally we've introduced `map` and `for_each` to `Stream`. And we've
added about a dozen new `FromStream` implementations for `std` types, bringing
us up to par with std's `FromIterator` implementations.

And finally we've added a new "unstable" `task::blocking` function which can be
used to convert blocking code into async code using a threadpool. We've been
using this internally for a while now to async-std to power our `fs` and
`net::SocketAddr` implementations. With this patch userland code now finally has
access to this too.

## Example

__Create a stream of tuples, and collect into a hashmap__
```rust
let a = stream::once(1u8);
let b = stream::once(0u8);

let s = a.zip(b);

let map: HashMap<u8, u8> = s.collect().await;
assert_eq!(map.get(&1), Some(&0u8));
```

__Spawn a blocking task on a dedicated threadpool__
```rust
task::blocking(async {
    println!("long-running task here");
}).await;
```

## Added

- Added `stream::Stream::map`
- Added `stream::Stream::for_each`
- Added `stream::Stream::try_for_each`
- Added `task::blocking` as "unstable"
- Added `FromStream` for all `std::{option, collections, result, string, sync}` types.
- Added the `path` submodule as "unstable".

## Changed

- Updated `futures-preview` to `0.3.0-alpha.19`, allowing us to build on `rustc 1.39.0-beta`.
- As a consequence of this upgrade, all of our concrete stream implementations
  now make use of `Stream::size_hint` to optimize internal allocations.
- We now use GitHub Actions through [actions-rs](https://github.com/actions-rs),
  in addition to Travis CI. We intend to fully switch in the near future.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.99.6 where Unix Domain Listeners would sometimes become unresponsive.
- Updated our `sync::Barrier` docs to match std.
- Updated our `stream::FromStream` docs to match std's `FromIterator`.
