/// Creates a new stream that yields at a set interval.

/// The stream first yields after `dur`, and continues to yield every
/// `dur` after that. The stream accounts for time elapsed between calls, and
/// will adjust accordingly to prevent time skews.
///
/// Each interval may be slightly longer than the specified duration, but never
/// less.
///
/// Note that intervals are not intended for high resolution timers, but rather
/// they will likely fire some granularity after the exact instant that they're
/// otherwise indicated to fire at.
